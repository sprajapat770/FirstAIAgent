## Key Concepts

### 🧠 LLM (Large Language Model)
A foundation model trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like text. Think of it as a brilliant scholar who has read millions of books but is frozen in time - they're the "brain" that provides reasoning capabilities but only knows what existed up to their training cutoff date. LLMs process language but don't act independently and cannot access real-time information or browse the internet.

### 🤖 Agent
An intelligent system that uses LLM reasoning to autonomously complete tasks and achieve goals. Agents combine language understanding with decision-making capabilities to act as the "actor" that can plan, reason, and execute actions.

### 🛠️ Tools
External functions, APIs, or capabilities that agents can call to interact with the world beyond text generation. Tools serve as the "hands" that extend an agent's abilities - like web search, file operations, database queries, or API calls.

**Key Difference**: LLM provides the intelligence, Agent provides the autonomy, and Tools provide the capabilities to interact with external systems.

### Flowchart Explanation:
1. **Start** → Initialize the AI agent
2. **LLM** → Process input and make decisions
3. **Tools** → Execute external functions when needed (with feedback loop to LLM)
4. **End** → Complete the task and provide response

The feedback loop shows how tools can send information back to the LLM for further processing.
